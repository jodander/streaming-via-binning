# README

The code is split into a few files.

## binning.py

Includes the code for approximating factorization mechanisms based on Algorithm 1 and computing their error.

## space_check.py

Includes code for double-checking that matrices have low space complexity.

## plots.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook file for reproducing all quantitative results, and plots, in the paper.

# A comment on dependencies

Only 'standard' (math, numpy, pandas,  matplotlib, ) modules are utilized with the exception of 'tueplots' for formatting the plots. It can be commented out in plots.ipynb.
