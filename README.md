# README

The code is split into a few files.

## binning.py

Includes the code for approximating factorization mechanisms based on Algorithm 1 and computing their error.

## space_check.py

Includes code for double-checking that matrices have low space complexity.

## plots.ipynb

Jupyter Notebook file for reproducing all the data for all plots in the paper.
Number of steps for different plots is scaled down to allow the entire notebook to run in a few minutes.
Plots generated are not stylized to look identical to plots in the paper.

# A comment on dependencies

Only 'standard' (math, numpy, pandas, matplotlib) modules are utilized.
